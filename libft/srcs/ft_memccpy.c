/*
DESCRIPTION
	The memccpy() function copies no more than n bytes from memory
	area src to memory area dest, stopping when the character c is found.
	If the memory areas overlap, the results are undefined.
RETURN VALUE
	The memccpy() function returns a pointer to the next character in dest
	after c, or NULL if c was not found in the first n characters of src.

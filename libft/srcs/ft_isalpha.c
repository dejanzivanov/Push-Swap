/*
DESCRIPTION
	isalpha() checks for an alphabetic character; in the standard "C" locale,
	it is equivalent to (isupper(c) || islower(c)).  In some locales, there
	may be additional characters for which isalpha() is trueâ€”letters which are
	neither uppercase nor lowercase.
RETURN VALUE
	The values returned are nonzero if the character c falls into the
	tested class, and zero if not.
